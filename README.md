- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

With the help from a member within the community, they told me about the source tag, and how it's used to add different images based on different breakpoints.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
  <source  media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.png">
  </picture>
```
### Continued development
Something that I have to work on familiarizing myself with the flexbox property.

I would like to acknowledge Grace-Snow, a member at Front End Mentor, for there help, because I was stuck on how to change the images based on different breakpoints. And They introduce to me the ```source``` tag that I can use in my html file.
